# ML Project

This is a containerized production-grade machine learning project to deploy and serve a model using a REST API in Red Hat OpenShift. The project is structured to follow best practices in software engineering and machine learning. It includes CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, logging, and observability configurations.

## Project Components

1. **Machine Learning Model**
    - Logistic Regression model for binary image classification
    - Implemented using NumPy and SciKit-Learn
    - Model training and evaluation scripts

2. **API Service**
    - FastAPI framework for creating RESTful API endpoints
    - Endpoints for model inference, health checks, and model information
    - Request validation and error handling

3. **Documentation**
    - MkDocs for generating project documentation
    - API documentation using Swagger UI
    - Tutorials for data preparation and model training

4. **Containerization**
    - Dockerfile for building the application container
    - Docker Compose for local development and testing

5. **Deployment**
    - Kubernetes manifests for deploying on OpenShift
    - Helm charts for parameterized deployments

6. **CI/CD Pipeline**
    - ArgoCD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

7. **Monitoring and Logging**
    - Prometheus for metrics collection
    - Grafana dashboards for visualization
    - ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log management

8. **Testing**
    - Unit tests for individual components
    - Integration tests for API endpoints
    - Load testing scripts using Locust

9. **Data Management**
    - Scripts for data preparation and preprocessing
    - Data version control using DVC

10. **Model Management**
    - MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning

11. **Security**
    - HTTPS encryption for API communication
    - JWT authentication for API access
    - Container security scanning using Trivy

12. **Configuration Management**
    - Environment-specific configurations
    - Secrets management using Kubernetes Secrets

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Prepare your data: `python data/prepare_data.py`
4. Train the model: `python model/train.py`
5. Run the API locally: `uvicorn api.main:app --reload`
6. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t logistic-regression-classifier .`
7. Deploy to OpenShift: Follow the instructions in `docs/deployment.md`

## Documentation

This project uses MkDocs for comprehensive documentation. MkDocs is a fast, simple, and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

Our documentation covers:

- Project overview and architecture
- API endpoints and usage
- Model training and evaluation processes
- Deployment instructions
- Troubleshooting guide

To view the documentation locally:

1. Ensure MkDocs is installed: `pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material`
2. Navigate to the project root directory
3. Run: `mkdocs serve`
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`

The documentation is also automatically built and deployed with each update to the main branch, and can be accessed online at [your-project-docs-url].

To build the documentation for production:

```bash
mkdocs build
```
