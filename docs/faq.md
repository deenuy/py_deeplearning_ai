# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is this Logistic Regression Image Classifier?
This project implements a logistic regression model for binary image classification. It's designed to classify images into two categories (e.g., cats vs. non-cats, or selfies vs. non-selfies).

### Who is this project for?
This project is ideal for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and students who want to understand and implement logistic regression for image classification.

### What are the main features of this project?
- Logistic Regression model for binary image classification
- FastAPI-based API for making predictions
- Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
- Docker support for easy deployment

## Technical Questions

### What programming language is used?
The project is primarily written in Python.

### What are the main dependencies?
The main dependencies include:
- NumPy for numerical computations
- Scikit-learn for machine learning utilities
- FastAPI for the API framework
- Pillow for image processing

Check the `requirements.txt` file for a complete list.

### How do I install the required dependencies?
Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your project directory.

### What image formats are supported?
The classifier supports common image formats like JPEG, PNG, and BMP.

## Model Questions

### How accurate is the logistic regression model?
The accuracy of the model can vary depending on the dataset and the complexity of the classification task. Typically, for simple binary classification tasks, logistic regression can achieve good accuracy. Check the model evaluation metrics in the documentation for specific performance details.

### Can I use this model for multi-class classification?
This implementation is specifically for binary classification. For multi-class problems, you would need to modify the model to use techniques like one-vs-rest or softmax regression.

### How large should my training dataset be?
The size of the dataset depends on the complexity of your classification task. Generally, the more diverse and representative your dataset is, the better. Start with at least a few hundred images per class and increase if needed.

## API Questions

### How do I make a prediction using the API?
Send a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with your image data. Refer to the API documentation for detailed instructions and example code.

### Is there a limit to the size of images I can send to the API?
Yes, there is a limit to prevent overloading the server. The exact limit is specified in the API documentation. Generally, it's best to resize large images before sending them to the API.

### Is the API secure?
The API implements basic security measures, but if you're deploying this in a production environment, you should implement additional security features like API keys, rate limiting, and HTTPS.

## Deployment Questions

### Can I deploy this on cloud platforms?
Yes, the project includes a Dockerfile, making it easy to deploy on various cloud platforms that support Docker containers.

### How do I update the model in a production environment?
To update the model, retrain it with new data, save the new model file, and update the model file in your deployment. You may need to restart the API service to load the new model.

### What are the system requirements for running this project?
The project can run on most modern systems with Python 3.7+ installed. For processing large datasets or many simultaneous API requests, a system with adequate CPU and RAM is recommended.
