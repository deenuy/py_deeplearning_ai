## Installation Issues

### Problem: Dependencies fail to install

**Symptom**: Error messages when running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure you're using Python 3.7+
2. Update pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
3. Install dependencies one by one to identify problematic packages
4. Check for conflicting dependencies in `requirements.txt`

### Problem: ImportError when running the application

**Symptom**: `ImportError: No module named 'some_module'`

**Solution**:
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Activate your virtual environment if you're using one
3. Check your PYTHONPATH environment variable

## Model Training Problems

### Problem: Model not converging

**Symptom**: Loss doesn't decrease or fluctuates wildly during training

**Solutions**:
1. Check your learning rate - try a smaller value
2. Normalize your input data
3. Increase the number of training iterations
4. Check for data quality issues or labeling errors

### Problem: Overfitting

**Symptom**: High accuracy on training data, low accuracy on test data

**Solutions**:
1. Increase your training data size
2. Implement regularization (L1 or L2)
3. Use cross-validation to tune hyperparameters
4. Simplify your model if it's too complex for the dataset

## Prediction Errors

### Problem: Unexpected classification results

**Symptom**: Model consistently misclassifies certain types of images

**Solutions**:
1. Check your test data for quality and correctness
2. Ensure your image preprocessing matches the training process
3. Retrain your model with more diverse data
4. Consider using data augmentation to improve generalization

### Problem: "ValueError: Input contains NaN, infinity or a value too large for dtype('float64')"

**Symptom**: This error occurs during prediction

**Solution**:
1. Check your input data for invalid values
2. Ensure your image preprocessing step handles all potential input correctly
3. Add error handling to catch and handle invalid inputs gracefully

## API Connection Issues

### Problem: Unable to connect to the API

**Symptom**: Requests to the API endpoint fail

**Solutions**:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the API endpoint URL is correct
3. Ensure your API key is valid and correctly included in the request headers
4. Check if the API service is down or under maintenance

### Problem: Rate limit exceeded

**Symptom**: Receiving 429 Too Many Requests errors

**Solution**:
1. Implement exponential backoff in your requests
2. Reduce the frequency of your API calls
3. Contact support for increased rate limits if needed

## Performance Concerns

### Problem: Slow prediction times

**Symptom**: API requests take longer than expected to return results

**Solutions**:
1. Optimize your image preprocessing pipeline
2. Consider using a smaller model or quantizing your existing model
3. Implement caching for frequent requests
4. Scale your API infrastructure if under high load

### Problem: High memory usage

**Symptom**: Application consumes more memory than expected

**Solutions**:
1. Profile your application to identify memory leaks
2. Optimize large data structures in your code
3. Implement batch processing for large datasets
4. Consider using a memory-efficient model architecture

## Deployment Challenges

### Problem: Docker container fails to start

**Symptom**: Error messages when trying to run the Docker container

**Solutions**:
1. Check Docker logs for specific error messages
2. Ensure all necessary files are included in the Docker image
3. Verify your Dockerfile is correctly configured
4. Check for conflicts in port mappings or volume mounts

### Problem: Model file not found in production

**Symptom**: Application can't locate the trained model file

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure the model file is included in your deployment package
2. Check file permissions on the server
3. Verify the file path in your configuration is correct
4. Use absolute paths instead of relative paths in production
