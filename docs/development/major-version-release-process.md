# Major Version Release Process

This document outlines the step-by-step process for implementing and deploying a major version release in our production environment.

## Process Flow

1. **Release Planning**
    - Conduct extensive planning for the major release, including breaking changes.
    - Create a milestone in JIRA to track all related epics and stories.
    - Update the product roadmap to reflect the major version changes.

2. **Create Major Version Branch**
    - From the `develop` branch, create a new major version branch:
      ```
      git checkout develop
      git pull
      git checkout -b major-v2.0.0
      ```

3. **Implement Features and Breaking Changes**
    - Developers implement planned features, improvements, and breaking changes in the major version branch.
    - Each significant change should have its own commit:
      ```
      git add .
      git commit -m "Feature: Description of the major change (JIRA-2000)"
      ```

4. **Run Comprehensive Tests**
    - Developers run extensive unit, integration, and system tests:
      ```
      pytest
      ```
    - Conduct thorough manual testing of new features and changes.

5. **Push Major Version Branch**
    - Push the major version branch to the remote repository:
      ```
      git push -u origin major-v2.0.0
      ```

6. **GitHub Actions Triggered**
    - Pushing to a `major-*` branch automatically triggers the GitHub Actions workflow.
    - Automated tests are run on the major version branch.

7. **Create Pull Request**
    - Create a pull request from `major-v2.0.0` to `main`.
    - Include a comprehensive description of all changes, breaking changes, and reference relevant JIRA tickets.

8. **Extensive Code Review**
    - Team conducts a thorough review of all changes in the major release.
    - If changes are requested, developers make updates and push again, triggering another GitHub Actions run.

9. **Update Changelog**
    - Update `CHANGELOG.md` with detailed information about the new major release:
      ```markdown
      ## [2.0.0] - 2023-09-01
      ### Added
      - Major new feature X (JIRA-2000)
      - Completely revamped feature Y (JIRA-2001)
      
      ### Changed
      - Breaking: Changed API endpoint structure (JIRA-2002)
      - Breaking: Updated authentication mechanism (JIRA-2003)
      
      ### Removed
      - Deprecated feature Z removed (JIRA-2004)
      
      ### Fixed
      - Major performance issue in core functionality (JIRA-2005)
      ```

10. **Update Version Number**
    - Update version number to 2.0.0 in all relevant files (e.g., `setup.py`, `__init__.py`, `package.json`)

11. **Update Documentation**
    - Thoroughly update all documentation to reflect the major changes.
    - This includes API docs, user guides, and developer documentation.

12. **Comprehensive Testing**
    - Conduct extensive testing of all features, especially focusing on areas with breaking changes.
    - Perform load testing and security audits.

13. **Beta Release (Optional)**
    - Consider releasing a beta version to a subset of users for early feedback.

14. **Final Review and Approval**
    - Conduct a final review meeting with all stakeholders.
    - Obtain formal approval for the major release.

15. **Merge to Main Branch**
    - Once approved and thoroughly tested, merge the major version branch into `main`:
      ```
      git checkout main
      git merge --no-ff major-v2.0.0
      git push origin main
      ```

16. **GitHub Actions Triggered**
    - Merging to `main` triggers the full GitHub Actions workflow.

17. **Create Release Tag**
    - GitHub Actions creates a new git tag:
      ```
      git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Major Release 2.0.0"
      git push origin v2.0.0
      ```

18. **Deploy to Staging**
    - GitHub Actions deploys to staging environment.
    - Conduct final checks in the staging environment.

19. **Run Full Integration Tests**
    - Run comprehensive integration tests in the staging environment.

20. **Deploy to Production**
    - If all tests pass, initiate the production deployment process.
    - This may involve a phased rollout strategy.

21. **Monitor Deployment**
    - Closely monitor all systems during and after deployment.
    - Be prepared for potential rollback if critical issues arise.

22. **Post-Deployment Verification**
    - Conduct thorough post-deployment checks.
    - Verify all new features and changes are working as expected in production.

23. **Merge Major Version to Develop**
    - Merge the major version changes back to `develop`:
      ```
      git checkout develop
      git merge main
      git push origin develop
      ```

24. **Close JIRA Milestone**
    - Update and close all JIRA tickets associated with the major release.
    - Close the major release milestone in JIRA.

25. **Communicate Release**
    - Announce the new major release to all stakeholders.
    - This may include blog posts, emails to customers, and internal communications.

26. **Update Roadmap**
    - Update the product roadmap to reflect the completed major version and future plans.

## Notes

- A major version release often involves breaking changes. Ensure these are clearly communicated to all users and stakeholders.
- Consider providing migration guides for users updating from the previous major version.
- The timeline for a major release is typically longer than for minor releases or hotfixes. Plan accordingly.
- Engage with key customers or beta testers before the full release if possible.
- Be prepared for increased support requests following a major release.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

Our GitHub Actions workflow (`ci-cd.yml`) automates several steps in this process, including:
- Running comprehensive automated tests
- Updating the changelog
- Bumping the version number
- Creating release tags
- Deploying to staging and production

Refer to the `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` file for the exact configuration of our CI/CD pipeline.

## Post-Release

- Conduct a comprehensive retrospective to review the entire major release process.
- Document lessons learned and update processes as necessary.
- Monitor user feedback closely in the weeks following the release.
- Be prepared to quickly address any unforeseen issues with hotfixes.
